## Can you write me an example of IELTS Essay That is likely to get a high score.

I'd be happy to provide an example of an IELTS essay that could potentially receive a high score. However, please keep in mind that this is just an example and that the actual essay you write for the test should be original and written in your own words.

### Example 1

Here is an example of an IELTS Writing Task 2 essay that could potentially receive a high score:

Prompt: Some people believe that children should begin learning a foreign language at primary school, while others think that it is better to wait until secondary school. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

It is a widely debated topic whether children should begin learning a foreign language at primary school or wait until secondary school. Both perspectives have valid arguments and should be considered.

On one hand, those who advocate for starting foreign language instruction in primary school argue that children are more receptive to learning new languages at a young age. They also point out that starting early gives children a head start in building language proficiency, which can be beneficial for future educational and career opportunities. Additionally, learning a foreign language can also promote cultural understanding and global citizenship.

On the other hand, those who believe that children should wait until secondary school to begin learning a foreign language argue that primary school is a crucial time for children to develop basic skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. They argue that children should focus on these core subjects in primary school and wait until secondary school to begin learning a foreign language. Additionally, they point out that primary school students may lack the attention span and maturity required to learn a foreign language effectively.

In my opinion, I believe that children should begin learning a foreign language at primary school. While it is important for children to develop basic skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics, I believe that learning a foreign language can complement and enhance these skills. Additionally, starting early allows children to build proficiency gradually, which can make the language-learning process more manageable and less intimidating. Furthermore, as globalisation continues to increase, the ability to speak multiple languages will be increasingly important for future educational and career opportunities.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for both sides, I believe that children should begin learning a foreign language at primary school. By starting early, children can take advantage of their natural language-learning abilities, build proficiency gradually, and develop important skills that will benefit them in the future.

This essay presents a clear and well-organized structure, starting with an introduction that presents the main topic and thesis, several body paragraphs that support the thesis with specific examples and evidence, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis.

It also shows a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, using a variety of sentence types, such as simple, compound, and complex. Additionally, it is well-supported with relevant examples and evidence, and includes balanced and well-reasoned arguments and counterarguments. Finally, the essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the task and the topic, and presents the ideas in a well-developed and logical manner.

### Example 2

Sure, here's another example of an IELTS Writing Task 2 essay that could potentially receive a high score:

Prompt: In many countries, the number of people who own cars is increasing. What are the reasons for this trend? What are the effects of this trend on individuals and society?

The number of people who own cars has been increasing in many countries for several reasons. One of the main reasons is the increasing availability and affordability of cars. With the advancements in technology and manufacturing processes, cars are now more affordable for a wider range of people. Additionally, the rise of car-sharing services and rental options has made it easier for people to access cars without having to purchase one themselves.

Another reason for the increasing number of car owners is the growing population and urbanization. As cities continue to grow and expand, more people are moving to urban areas where owning a car can be seen as a necessity for transportation and mobility. Furthermore, with the increasing number of job opportunities in urban areas, people are more likely to own cars to commute to work.

The effects of this trend on individuals and society are both positive and negative. On the positive side, owning a car provides individuals with greater freedom and flexibility in terms of transportation. It also allows for greater access to job opportunities and can improve overall economic productivity. Additionally, owning a car can also improve the standard of living for people living in rural areas where public transportation is limited.

However, there are also negative effects of this trend on individuals and society. One of the main negative effects is the increase in traffic congestion and air pollution. With more cars on the road, traffic jams and long commutes are becoming increasingly common, which can lead to increased stress and decreased quality of life. Additionally, the increase in car emissions can contribute to poor air quality, which can have negative effects on public health.

In conclusion, the increasing number of people who own cars is due to the increasing availability and affordability of cars, as well as the growing population and urbanization. While owning a car can provide individuals with greater freedom and flexibility, it also has negative effects on traffic congestion and air pollution. Therefore, it is important for governments and individuals to consider the long-term effects of this trend and take action to mitigate the negative impacts.

As in the previous example, this essay presents a clear and well-organized structure, starting with an introduction that presents the main topic and thesis, several body paragraphs that support the thesis with specific examples and evidence, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the thesis. The essay also demonstrates a high level of coherence and cohesion, meaning that the ideas and sentences are logically connected and easy to follow. It also shows a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, using a variety of sentence types, such as simple, compound, and complex. Additionally, it is well-supported with relevant examples and evidence, and includes balanced and well-reasoned arguments and counterarguments. Finally, the essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the task and the topic, and presents the ideas in a well-developed and logical manner.
